- display message if no room found with given code
  - make sure its case / whitespace insensitive

    1) enter name first (is it possible to retrieve last name used with anonymous auth?)
    2) then choose to create new game or join existing
- datastore validation rule to ensure logged in user can only add / remove themselves from player lists

- cant re-reveal hidden word on mobile
- purple highlight should drop after submitting

- need feedback after a guess, maybe an animation?
  - reveal to guesser and spymaster what the result was more clearly

- slightly tint the background with the current team's turn?

- be able to re-select a role after initial selection

- should spymasters enter their clues and specify a number?
  - just verbal to start?
  - how does turn switch?
    - if team's guess is wrong
    - also need a button i guess to switch turns?
